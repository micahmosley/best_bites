# This is Best Bites

Best Bites is a simple and easy to use web application that allows the user to favorite a meal and dessert, as well as display them on their profile page. The user can pick a favorite from a user-created list OR create their own. When selecting on a food item, the user is able to access a recipe url for that food item as well as the number of favorites it currently has, and the user can also see the top favorited meals and desserts from their own respective top-ten pages.
